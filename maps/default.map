# A map layout contains the following data:
#  PERSISTENCE: a persistence value for Perlin noise
#  AMPLITUDE_INIT: initial ampltiude for Perlin noise. Allows you to control how much noise is added to the given set of points.
#  SHIFT: a shifting of the points passed to the Perlin noise generator. Practically serves as a random seed.
#  WIDTH: the map width
#  HEIGHT: the map height
#  x,y: a point on the map
#
# One may provide a list of points which are then modified through Perlin noise on game startup.
# The points MUST be provided in increasing x! Otherwise, bad things will happen
